Description: This package resulted from a series of student projects in the context of the seminar 
    Advanced Statistical Programming 2020 of the University of Göttingen. Thus, it is part of a bundle 
    of the asp20__ packages. The main goal of these projects is implement a method to estimate 
    location-scale regression models. Each project's package implements a different method. All packages,
    including asp20boost, build upon the asp20model package. Specifically, an R6-class with inherited 
    properties from asp20model is asp20model expanded in the asp20boost-package.
