This vignette documents the exentions of the `asp20model` package of the `asp20` repository [@R-asp20model] provided to us in the context of the course "Advanced Statistical Programming with R". 

The present package extention allows for estimation of location-scale regression models considering location ($\beta$) and scale ($\gamma$) parameters. For this purpose, we utilized a gradient boosting algorythm, which aims to imporve a certain loss function. This algorythm optimizes the model parameter vectors ($\beta$ and $\gamma$) at each iteration by regressing the gradients. The goodness of fit of the gradient boosting algorythm was evaluated using simulated data. Results showed that ...

This extenstion is usefull as it provides a solution for estimation of heteroskedastic data, which has not been implemented in the `asp20model` package so far. What you can else do (future perspects?).....
